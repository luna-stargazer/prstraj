The repository contains files modified from https://github.com/luna-stargazer/rhps_coalescent/tree/master/small_example, 
please read through the original repo first  

Scripts contain directories from my account, please modify those to save to your local or cluster directory!

STEP1. To start, run "loop_pheno_sims_reps_mod.R sel_start sel_end phen_nums", where sel_start=selection start time (from current), sel_end=selection end time(from current), phen_nums=number of phenotypes interested in simulating
i.e loop_pheno_sims_reps_mod.R 0.04 0.02 100

Read the Relate documentation prepared by the Myers group:
https://myersgroup.github.io/relate/getting_started.html#GettingStarted

Please read the Rscript pheno_sim_1iter.R in this repo (modified from original), especially the chunk of code relevant for relate data output (comes after RENT+ data read-in and tree inference). Feel free to modify the RELATE related code (pun not intended) if needed 

Check to see that you have appropriately named data in the specified folders after STEP1.

STEP2. Do "sh batch.analyze.sh" to batch submit scripts. Note that again directory in batch.analyze.sh and the analyze_tree scripts (i.e. analyze.tree0.02.sh) needs to be subsituted with your own directory
To do this more efficiently consider: https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-use-sed-to-find-and-replace-text-in-files-in-linux-unix-shell/

Please adjust the settings for sbatch in analyze_tree scripts , e.g. job name, output, memory partition, as needed

STEP3. Please consult the plotting scripts in Doc's original repo for plotting:
